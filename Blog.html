        <p style="font-size: 17px">It is a known fact that every person on this planet knows something about technology. 
          This is because we humans have been inseparable with our technological devices and everyone 
          uses modern technology at some point during the day.
          The society has been dramatically changed with the evolution of technology.Before the advent of modern day technology, 
          life was burdensome and everyday chores consumed too much of our time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Immense opportunities are being provided by technologies which play an important role in our lives. 
          The access to education, medicine, industry, transportation etc. has been simplified due to technology. 
          Due to the convenience and efficiency provided by technology, our lives have improved significantly. 
          There used to be a time when executing a simple task like doing laundry would take most of the day. 
          Thanks to modern technology, a lot of burden has been lifted up from our shoulders and we have more time and energy 
          to do what we want to.

        <p style="font-size: 17px">Technology has an effect on every person around the globe, either positive or negative.
          As much as technological advances have simplified our lives and made them easier,
          they have as well brought about some negative impacts.With so many advantages and comfort, come the disadvantages
          too. Technology is being used imprudently these days resulting in affecting the society
          negatively and complicating our lives.

  <img src="../img/browser.jpg" height="500px"; width="100%"> <br> <br> <br>
       <p>Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard internet protocol suite to 
          billions of users worldwide. Internet has become increasing popular for many uses such as business marketing, online
          shopping and education which are just a few of the many advantages the internet can provide. It is a network that 
          consists of millions of private, public, academic, business and government networks of local to global scope that 
          are linked by a broad area of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.  <br>
        <p>
          The internet is the guiding technology of the IT Age just as the electrical engine was of the Industrial Age. The internet is a global network of inter-linked networks that mainly provide wireless interactive communication. Though the internet was first deployed in 1969, it was only in the 1990s that it became available to the public.
        </p>
        <br> 
          The internet carries a vast range of information and resources such as the internet linked hypertext documents of the world wide and 
          infrastructure to support electronic mail. Most traditional communication media including telephone, music, 
          film and defined the internet, giving birth to new services such as voice over internet protocol. Newspaper 
          print, books and other print publishing are adapting to website technology are reshaped into blogging and web feeds. 
          The internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interaction through instant messaging, internet forums 
          and social networking. Online shopping has boomed both for major retail, outlet and small traders.
        </p>
        <br>
        <!-- INTERNAL CSS FOR P TAG -->
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px; color: red;"> For instance did you know that ...</p> <br> <br>
          1. InternetLiveStats (ILS) monitors the active state of the internet, and as at October 2018, there are 4,045,421,895 users on the web. <br> <br>
          2. The first website created was info.cern.ch, and it is still online. <br> <br>
          3. As of October 2018, There are more than 1.9 billion websites on the Internet. <br> <br>
          4. 4 Billion out of the 7 Billion people on earth are already online. <br> <br>
          5. Home to 854 million netizens, China is the country with the highest number of internet users.
        </p> 
        <br> 
        <p>
          From there onwards, its use has diffused rapidly throughout the world with there being around 7 billion users of wireless devices currently that employ internet technology. With about 7.7 billion people in this world and with limited use among those under 5 years of age, it’s almost safe to say that the entire humanity is now connected to the internet! There are however variations in the bandwidths available, the efficiency and cost of its use.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s been postulated that about 95% of all information available has been digitized and made accessible via the internet. The internet has also led to a complete transformation in communication, availability of knowledge as well as social interaction. However, as with all major technological changes, there are positive and negative effects of the internet on the society too.

    <h1>Positive aspects of technology</h1><hr> <br> <br>

    <br> <br>
        <p> 
          Technology has brought many advantages in the favour of its users.
          Be it growing education organization or a fast food company, internet has wrapped itself around the globe. 
          A very important aspect of technology is its impact on education. 
          Students are therefore likely to do research on essay, tutorials and learn about the things on the internet so as to understand gain more knowledge. 
          Obviously, technology has improved knowledge delivery and there are many resources that students can use to learn like computers and PowerPoint presentations.
        </p>  
        <p> 
          There are several positive Internet access impacts on the developing countries. 
          Access to wide range of information, new job opportunities, broader education, to name but a few. 
          With an access to wide range of information, people could contribute to the more democratic society. 
          They can use examples from other, developed countries, and implement them in their own.
        </p> 
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p>
          The positive impacts of the internet include the following: 
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
          It provides effective communication using emailing and instant messaging services to any part of the world. <br>

          It improves business interactions and transactions, saving on vital time. <br> <br>
          Banking and shopping online have made life less complicated. <br> <br>
          You can access the latest news from any part of the world without depending on the TV or newspaper. <br> <br>
          Education has received a huge boost as uncountable books and journals are available online from libraries across the world. 
          This has made research easier. Students can now opt for online courses using the internet. <br> <br>
          Application for jobs has also become easier as most vacancies are advertised online with online applications becoming the norm. <br> <br>
          Professionals can now exchange information and materials online, thus enhancing research. <br> <br>

  <br> <br>
        <p>
          Another negative aspect dealing with the use of the Internet is the potential for hacking. 
          Hacking into a computer through the Internet is used often in our everyday lives of modern societies. 
          Email addresses can be hacked into and the hackers will get access to the one’s password and emails along with one’s contacts. 
          Furthermore, those who fill out their personal information and send it away to advertisements can also be hacked into and all of their personal information can be stolen. 
          Therefore, the internet is rather hazardous and is becoming used all around the world. 
          New users are unaware of these negative aspects but these new comers will soon discover the hard way what negative implications Internet usage may bring.

        </p> 
        <br> <br>
        <p>The negative impacts of the internet on society include: <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Easy availability of illegal or inappropriate materials online that isn’t age-suitable. <br> <br>
          Addiction to social networks can disrupt an individual’s life, both personally and professionally. <br> <br> 
          Some miscreants use the internet to hack into people’s accounts for spurious activities including stealing data or banking information. <br> <br>
          Yet others have been known to misuse the internet for spreading hate and terrorism, two dangerously catastrophic scenarios. <br> <br> 
          However, those indulging in misusing the internet are few and far in-between. <br> <br>
          On a global scale, the internet has been the best thing to have happened to human society in recent years!

  <h1>Verdict</h1><hr>
        <p>
          Internet has become on one the basic needs for every day life. 
          We can not even imagine a life with out the internet. 
          As all things, the Internet also has some pros and cons. 
          But in my opinion, the positive aspects of the internet technology outwheighs the negative aspects.
          The major role of internet has been for education. With the access to the internet, people can learn new things.
          Nowdays everything and anything happening in the world currently can be seen on a small smartphone device. 
          This has also helped connect billions of people on the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 4 billion people have been estimated to be online throughout the world, which consists of more than 60% of the all the prople in the world.
          This creates an opportunity and platform for content creators to share their ideas or unheard information with the whole world.
          The Information Communication Technology (ICT) has also been developed due to this.
        <br>
          Internet has changed our life and it is not different for students. The worldwide web offers a wealth of information which can be useful for every kind of information. 
          Many students don’t need to visit the library no more for research because you can find a plenty of encyclopaedias and many education sites when you browse through different internet sites. 
          It is not only a source of information but you can also follow some online courses which may benefit knowledge about a certain course. 
          It is also a used for communication with others students and even professors. 
          There are several kinds of education where you need to consult a certain protected internet page to know your daily tasks and even the date and hour when the course take place. 
          Facebook and other networking sites are popular between students to share knowledge. 
          They may also use some messaging services of the internet, for example yahoo messenger, window live messenger, mail which allows chatting between students.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short we can say that internet is a blessing when used wisely and appropreriately. After all these things we can say that the internet and technology totally effected to the higher education. 
          Now everything is possible to do with the help of internet. Technology makes the education much easier so the higher education becomes so easy and intrusting.
